# Epoch Core Tasks
## Where are Datasets?
So due to the huge size of the alphabets dataset, I've chosen not to push it on to github (I'll push it at a later date). For the Epoch heads, I'm assuming you guys will have the data downloaded already, so just set the structure to be, alphabets_dataset/alphabet_images/ and the alphabet labels to be in alphabets_dataset/alphabet_labels.csv . Hopefully all other data should be there. For any curious viewer who is interested (I highly doubt), send me a mail at faheemarif0206@gmail.com if I haven't uploaded it already. If you know me personally, just ask.
## Task 1
Just open Epoch_Task1.ipynb, most of the required information has been put in there. Please do note, there is one codeblock that will result in an error. This was done on purpose so as to show my line of thinking. My documentation was not upto point, but near the end, it's pretty detailed, so don't miss it.
### Required Libraries (this should be a requirements.txt I think, I'll do that soon too)
- Pandas
- Numpy
- MatPlotLib
- sklearn
- seaborn
- geopandas
- random
- copy
## Task 2
Same as task 1. There are two codeblocks that don't run on my system (something about tensorflow.keras not downloading properly, so I've run the code writing it like tf.keras.layers.xyz)
Also, documentation may seem a bit lacking in the early parts of the document, but they get pretty detailed later on. I've also written a pseudocode / approach for identifying letters in a general scenario in a pretty detailed manner.
### Required Libraries (this should be a requirements.txt I think, I'll do that soon too)
- TensorFlow
- nltk
- Pandas
- Numpy
- PIL
- os
- MatPlotLib
- sklearn
- seaborn
- geopandas
- random
- copy

## PS
Will upload the PS soon too ðŸ«¡
